# VisualFeedbackPlugin

This project provides the visual feedback environment for a home-based interactive stroke rehabilitation system developed with a team of other students and faculty as part of my graduate work at Arizona State University (ASU)

Currently this project functions as a plugin for MacOS software developed by Loren Olson at ASU, which is not yet publicly available

This project therefore will not run as a standalone project yet until future updates are made

This project is being transported from another private repo, requires some cleaning, and links to supporting SDKs. (To be updated)

Overview:

This project functions as part of a larger interactive system that provides audiovisual feedback based on the upper extremity and torso movement performance of a stroke survivor performing a series of functional tasks. This project receives data analysis results from other plugins (not included here) and displays the appropriate feedback.

Three levels of visual feedback are provided

- A rock path is drawn to provide feedback on the magnitude and direction of trajectory error during an individual reach.
- A boat image with a unique shape is displayed based on the overall quality of trajectory performance after a series of repetitive reaches. 
- A short animation of a boat traveling through variable types of weather is displayed based on the overall quality of a complex sequence or transport task.
